    <p>
        This is the process page, where I will be showing the process of how I made this website, and what I did to make it.
        The making of this website took a while, mainly on the first 'disk' dragging/sliding part. It took up
        most of my time, and I had to learn a lot of new things to make it work. I mainly used Youtube, W3Schools,
        Co-Pilot AI, mainly and strictly for debugging and new ideas, and Stack Overflow for any questions I had.
        Screenshots of some of the code I used will be shown below.



        ( Or I'll just explain it in class.)
