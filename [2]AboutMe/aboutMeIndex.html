    <p>
      Hello, My name is Eric Coe, if you couldn't tell I'm a NexTech Catapult Student. <br>
       Before getting into that, I am currently a Junior, 
       going into my senior year in the fall at Warren Central High School. <br>
        I became a NexTech Catapult Student because I wanted to learn more 
        about the <br> world of technology and how it can be applied in 
        real-world scenarios.<br> Mainly to try to improve my Javascript 
        knowledge. <br> I like doing website development, and I am currently
         learning more about it through this program.<br> I have a passion for
          coding and enjoy creating interactive web applications.
          <br> I also have an interest in game development and hope to explore 
           that further in the future,<br> but I am also interested in other 
           areas of technology such as game development, <br>cybersecurity, and 
           artificial intelligence. <br>I like the techinical side, the building
            side of coding, which is why I was originally interested when <br>
             findin about NexTech, though I woudn't mainly be doing pure
              coding, I'd still enjoy the <br> Website Development aspect of it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in continuous learning and strive to improve my skills every day. 
      For a overview of my skills, you can check out the skill page, or if wanting to ask any questions, refer to the contact page.
